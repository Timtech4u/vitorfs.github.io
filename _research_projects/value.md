Our main goal is to provide a mechanism for companies to forecast the overall value associated with a decision relating
to software/product management and development.


**Identification of VALUE**

We identify, in collaboration with our business partners, the factors that they use intrinsically in their decision
making, which represent their understanding about what Value means, and to whom.

The outcome is an explicit set of Value Factors that represent the viewpoints from different stakeholders. Such outcome
also provides a common vocabulary, so taking away subjectivity and misunderstandings.


**Decision Support for VALUE**

Using the VALUE Tool, each stakeholder estimates the impact that they believe the implementation of a particular set of
features/ideas/requirements/etc will likely have upon each of the previously identified VALUE factors.

The VALUE Tool also provides a dashboard that presents the aggregated views from different stakeholders using numerous
visualization techniques. These visualizations aim to support stakeholders’ discussions and decisions.


**Prediction of VALUE**

The end goal of VALUE is to provide a solution, using Bayesian Network, where past aggregated data from decision making
meetings, combined with basic research on automatic uncertainty quantification, can be used to provide the overall
value of a feature/idea/requirement/etc being discussed, in case it is selected for implementation into an existing
product/project. The technique chosen – Bayesian Network, enables the representation of the uncertainty that is
inherent to decision making scenarios and experts’ knowledge.
