Even though I placed Woid here in my experiments, actually I find it very useful and I use it on daily basis. I have
a pinned tab in my Web browser and from time to time I check for updates.

Woid is a very simple news aggregator. It keeps the track of some of my favorite Websites and list the top stories. It
updates every 5 minutes. So in a single page I can have an idea of what is going on. There is also an archive so I
never miss a big story.
