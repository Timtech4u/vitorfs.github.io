Bloodhound was my second Web crawler and it is very similar to the [Sea Serpent][sea-serpent], except it crawls an
e-commerce from Finland. It is a little be less interesting because there is no comparison with other e-commerce.

This time the code look better and I used some third party libraries to make my life easier.
