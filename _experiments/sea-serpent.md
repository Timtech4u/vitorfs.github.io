This was my first experience developing a Web crawler. The code is very raw and naive. But it works.

The Sea Serpent was designed to crawl three e-commerce websites from Brazil and monitor price changes from all the
available products. In the web interface you could see the price changes over the time and compare prices from the
other e-commerces.
