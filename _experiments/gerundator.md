Gerundator is a small jQuery plugin I created a couple of years ago. It is meant to add loading states to action
buttons. It only works for the Portuguese language though.

The name _Gerundator_ is a joke, meaning it will take a verb and turn it into its gerund form. For example,
if the action button text is "Salvar" (Save), when the user clicks the button, the plugin turns the text into
"Salvando…" (Saving…) while the async request is processing and turns it back to "Salvar" when it completes.

The plugin does it automatically, so you don't need to write manually what would be the loading state name.
