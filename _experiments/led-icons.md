This small project was inspired by the The LED Icon Set, a collection of 512 16x16 icons developed by [led24.de][led24].

I compiled all the icons into a single sprite file and created a CSS file for easily usage on web pages. I used to use
those icons alot in the past. Nowadays I prefer font icons because if its responsiveness.
