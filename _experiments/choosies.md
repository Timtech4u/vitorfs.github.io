You know that hand game where one player pick _odd_ and the other pick _even_, and then they simultaneously reveals
their hand, extending any number of fingers. The player who successfully guesses the total sum of fingers being odd or
even, scores a point.

Choosies is a Django implementation of this hand game. It mainly uses AJAX requests to control the state of the game.
I might do anytime soon a new implementation of this game using the new Django Sockets resource.
