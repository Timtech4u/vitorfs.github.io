Bootcamp is an open source **enterprise social network** built with [Python][0] using the [Django Web Framework][1].

The project has three basic apps:

* Feed (A Twitter-like microblog)
* Articles (A collaborative blog)
* Question & Answers (A Stack Overflow-like platform)

#### Feed App

The Feed app has infinite scrolling, activity notifications, live updates for likes and comments, and comment tracking.

#### Articles App

The Articles app is a basic blog, with articles pagination, tag filtering and draft management.

#### Question & Answers App

The Q&A app works just like Stack Overflow. You can mark a question as favorite, vote up or vote down answers, accept an answer and so on.
