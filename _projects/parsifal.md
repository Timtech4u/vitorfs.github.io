Parsifal is an online tool designed to support researchers to perform systematic literature reviews within the context
of Software Engineering. Geographically distributed researchers can work together within a shared workspace, designing
the protocol and conducting the research.

As well as providing a way to document the whole process, the tool will help you remind what is important during a
systematic literature review. During the planning phase, Parsifal will help you with the objectives, PICOC, research
questions, search string, keywords and synonyms, selecting the sources, the inclusion and exclusion criterias. Parsifal
will also provide mechanisms to build a quality assessment checklist and data extraction forms.

During the conducting phase, you will be able to import bibtex files and select the studies, find duplicates among all
the different sources, execute the quality assessment and extract data from the papers.
