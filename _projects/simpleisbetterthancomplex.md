I created this blog to share some of my thoughts and experience about programming. To be honest, I'm no Python/Django
expert, but we all have something good to share. Besides, we learn much more by teaching what we know.

The name of this blog – if you are familiar with Python probably you already got the reference — was inspired by
“The Zen of Python”, created by Tim Peters, which is an easter egg that can be found in Python version 2.1.2 or later
by typing `import this` in a Python interpreter.
