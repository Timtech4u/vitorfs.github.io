<h4>About me</h4>
<p>
  My name is <strong>Vitor Freitas</strong>, I'm a software developer and researcher from Brazil. At the moment, I'm living in Oulu,
  Finland doing my Ph.D. I'm a passionate software developer, currently working with Python and Django. I also worked
  several years in industry with Java, C♯ and ASP/VBScript.

<h4>About the website</h4>
<p>
  This is my personal website where you can find both resources related to my work as a software engineering <a href="/research/">researcher</a>
  and as an independent <a href="/projects/">web developer</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I write about my everyday work as a researcher and share learning experience while taking courses and reading
  scientific papers in my <a href="/research/phd/">Ph.D. learning diary</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I have the personal goal of learning something new everyday. For the most part it is related to programming and my
  work, but it can be really anything. I share this small thoughts in the <a href="/til/">today I learned (TIL)</a> section.
</p>
<p>
  I also publish on weekly basis articles about Python, Django and Web Development in my blog
  <a href="http://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com" target="_blank">simpleisbetterthancomplex.com</a>.
